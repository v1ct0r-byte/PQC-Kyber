IMPORTANT MATHEMATICAL NOTATION (BACKGROUND)

-> Beta is a set of whole numbers from 0 to 255. One example would be the set of unsigned 8-bit whole numbers.
-> Beta^k is the set of byte strings of length k.
-> Beta^* is the set of byte strings of arbitrary length.
-> Given two byte strings a and b, (a||b) depicts the concatenation of a and b.
-> The ring of whole numbers module q is Zq, where whole numbers are in the range [0,q].
-> R is the polynomial ring.
-> In KYBER the value of n = 7681 and q = 256.

-> There are two hash functions:
    H : B^* -> B^32, is a function that receives as input arbitrary length whole numbers and returns as output a whole number of length 32 (or a vector of such length).
    G : B^* -> B^32 x B^3, is a function that receives as input arbitrary length whole numbers and returns a matrix of size 32x32.
-> KDF (key derivation function) : B^* -> B^32.
-> Q are the rational numbers (numbers that can be represented and yield from the division of two other numbers).
-> [x] indicates the aproimation to the closest whole number (either by ceiling or floor) when x is from Q.
-> Let x be a number from the ring of whole numbers till q = 256, and let d < [log2q]:
    Compression function over q receives x and d
    Decrompression function over q receives x and d
-> CBD stands for Centered binomial distribution. It represents the domain from where some sunmbers are sampled from in a pseudo-random manner for byte arrays/vectors u and v.
