ASSUMPTIONS

We assume:  
    - Correctness of the encodings of s1 and s2, thus signatures are never rejected during the Verify algorithm.
    - We assume mod q equals mod (phi,q).
    - Any generated polynomials f g F & G always satisfy the equation fG-gF = q mod phi.
    - The signature and verification algorithms apply always in the bound given by their parameter Beta, 
      thus it is not deemed necesary in the specification of the corresponding rules.
