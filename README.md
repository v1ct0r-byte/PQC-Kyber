# Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in Maude

This repository stores Maude's system modules that construct the symbolic models of three postquantum cryptography mechanisms. The symbolic modules perform invariant analysis, find a MITM attack and model checking of a Safety and Liveness property. The analyzed mechanisms are:

- [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/)
- [Bike](https://bikesuite.org/)
- [Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org/)

Please check the corresponding [publication](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3280/paper3.pdf) for further insights on the symbolic specification and verification of Kyber.
