This repositoy stores the Maude's modules that construct the symbolic models of three postquantum cryptography mechanisms. The symbolic modules are used to perform invariant analysis, finding a MITM attack, and model checking of a Safety and Liveness property. The analyzed mechanisms are:

- Kyber (https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/)
- Bike ()
- Classic McEliece ()
